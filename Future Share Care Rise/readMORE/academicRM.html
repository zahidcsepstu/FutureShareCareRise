    <img src="img1.png" alt="Logo"/>
  <p>During our academic life in BSc in Engg(CSE),
     we have to study various courses,but many times we don't know why have to learn programming courses,algorithms,database etc.
     Sometimes we try to memorise programming codes to achieve a minimum CGPA,that ultimately brings no result & our academic life becomes more difficult to survive.<p>
     Here we will discuss about the whole engineering courses are studied by the CSE undergraduate students
     around the whole world.Then we can differentiate between the academic engineering life and job life of an engineer.
     These are quite differnent in terms and nature.What is learnt on academic life holds less importance on
     practical uses of those.Suppose you have studied a whole chapter on mysql,but when you mind to implement it for
     a client demand then you have to know a little bit about other related courses,such like jquery,html,php etc.
     So we build this website for gathering knowledge beside the main courses to meet with the future job requirements.
     For example of my thought,here I will give some website addresses of some renowed university,you can visit their website
     and get proper idea about the undergraduate courses of CSE.
     <br><br>
     Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) < University of California.<br>
     <a href="http://catalogue.uci.edu/allcourses/cse/">Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) < University of California .</a> <br><br>
      University of Washington - Seattle - Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering.<br>
     <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/">University of Washington - Seattle - Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering.</a> <br><br>
      University of Hawaii at Hilo.<br>
 
     <a href="  https://hilo.hawaii.edu/catalog/cs-courses"> University of Hawaii at Hilo</a> <br><br>
     
     University of Vermont.<br>

     <a href=" http://catalogue.uvm.edu/undergraduate/courses/courselist/cs/">University of Vermont</a> <br><br>
     
       Hope, you have visited the links given above.Now you have get an idea of all courses that studied in
       CS and CSE.
       Now we consider the undergraduate courses taken in CSE at Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology(BUET).
       By analysing their course list we will get a clear idea about the condition of our academic educational system of
       CSE in various public and private university. </p>

         <p>Now we see that there are many courses that are not used in our future job life but we have to
             study that courses for academic purposes like good result.For that sometimes many students put a less
             care on valuable courses.That would be harmful for our experimental future life.
