  <p>Now if we analysis the grade points achieved by most students in programming related courses
    then we get a low scoring result in these particular courses.Most students are commonly unaware of
    the importance attending in a programming contest,solving daily problems based on their course materials.
    Teachers want to make a huge programmer from their students but they don't find out proper way.
    A few number of students do daily programming contest and be prepared for their next move.
    But the most? What would be their future? If they are going to dogs?
    So,now the time to take proper step not to avoid the current sitution but to modify and find out the
    proper solution.Here,teachers can upload articles,project metarials for their students based on their
    semester courses and by that students will gather knowledge about the future need,implementation of their 
    academic courses.They will be interested in problem solving,system analysis,designing a project,writting article etc.
